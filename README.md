- About: http://localhost:3000/site/about.html
- Projects: http://localhost:3000/site/projects.html
- Contact: http://localhost:3000/site/contact.html
- Admin: http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html?admin=1

## Features

### Multi-Page Navigation
- Proper file-based routing (not hash anchors)
- Active page highlighting
- Responsive design
- Clean URLs supported (/about resolves to about.html)

### Admin Panel
Access at `/admin/index.html?admin=1` with token authentication:
- Section-based content (home, about, projects, contact)
- Create, edit, delete articles
- XSS-sanitized content
- Token-based auth (localStorage)

### Google Apps Script Deployment

To deploy as a Sheets Web App:

1. Open Google Sheets → Extensions → Apps Script
2. Create HTML files: index.html, about.html, projects.html, contact.html, admin.html
3. Copy ContentApi.gs to Code.gs
4. Set ADMIN_TOKEN in Script Properties
5. Deploy as Web App with "Anyone" access

Access pages: `?page=about`, `?page=projects`, etc.

## Security

- Admin panel hidden by default (requires ?admin=1 or token)
- XSS protection via escapeHTML()
- Token stored in localStorage only
- Apps Script validates tokens server-side

## Development

The server automatically serves:
- Static files from /site with clean URL support
- Admin panel from /admin
- LAUNCH.html as root (/)

No build step required - pure HTML/CSS/JS.
