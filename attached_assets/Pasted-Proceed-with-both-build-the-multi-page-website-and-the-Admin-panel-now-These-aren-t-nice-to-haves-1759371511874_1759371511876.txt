Proceed with both: build the multi-page website and the Admin panel now. These aren’t “nice-to-haves”—they’re core scope. And yes, keep the blockers you say are “fixed” stable while you do it.

Implementation orders & non-negotiables

Multi-page site (deliverable)

Pages: /index.html, /about.html, /projects.html, /contact.html

Shared assets: /styles.css, /app.js

Nav: header links must route to the correct separate pages (no in-page anchors). Persistent active-link highlight.

Copy is concise/professional (≤3-word headers).

Bundle returned as a Website artifact.

Admin sub-artifact (fully working)

Paths:

/admin/index.html, /admin/admin.js

/apps_script/ContentApi.gs (backend for Sheets Web App)

GS backend:

doGet(e):

GET /content → JSON { sections: { home:[], about:[], projects:[], contact:[] } }

optional GET /admin → serves admin HTML

doPost(e):

action: create|update|delete, section, id, title, body, token

Script Properties for token; no secrets in client.

Admin UI:

Discreet button in site chrome (visible if ?admin=1 or localStorage.adminToken).

CRUD per section, validation (title required, body ≥ 50 chars), toasts, optimistic UI w/ rollback on failure.

Content model (use this):

{
  "sections": {
    "home":    [{"id":"...", "title":"...", "body":"...", "updatedAt": 0}],
    "about":   [{"id":"...", "title":"...", "body":"...", "updatedAt": 0}],
    "projects":[{"id":"...", "title":"...", "body":"...", "updatedAt": 0}],
    "contact": [{"id":"...", "title":"...", "body":"...", "updatedAt": 0}]
  }
}


Return the Admin bundle as a sub-artifact of the website artifact.

Do not regress the fixes you shipped:

Car Mode: state machine + 3-sec VAD → finalize → transcribe → send → respond → idle. No “stuck listening,” no “repeat last message.”

DOCX: readable text, embedded charts (no raw URLs).

Sanitization: no prompt/system text leakage anywhere.

Tests you must include (part of this work, not optional)

Website E2E: clicking each header lands on the correct page; 404s handled; active nav state correct.

Admin E2E: create → edit → delete → persist via GS; token check enforced; XSS sanitized.

Contract tests for GET /content and POST /content (schema above).

Regression: Car Mode flows; DOCX contains image parts; HTML leak check (/system|prompt|instruction/i).

Deliverables

Website bundle + Admin sub-artifact + ContentApi.gs (ready to deploy via doGet/doPost).

Test notes and a quick “How to Deploy on Apps Script” snippet.

Short rollback notes (feature flags, files touched).

Go ahead and implement. If something’s truly blocking, say exactly which file/contract is ambiguous and ship a minimal, reversible stub behind a flag—otherwise, full build.
