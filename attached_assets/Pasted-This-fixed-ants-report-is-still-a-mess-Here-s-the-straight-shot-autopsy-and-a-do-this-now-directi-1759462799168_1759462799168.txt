This “fixed” ants report is still a mess. Here’s the straight-shot autopsy and a do-this-now directive for the Replit agent.

What’s wrong with the “Life Cycle of Ants” DOCX
1) Truncated, unfinished prose

Multiple sections end mid-sentence with ellipses—Executive Summary, Results, etc. It’s clearly cut off during generation/assembly. 

Comprehensive_DOCX_Report_Life_…

2) Placeholder figures (no actual visuals)

“Figure 1/2/3” exist in captions only; there are no embedded charts or images. It’s a label farm, not figures. 

Comprehensive_DOCX_Report_Life_…

3) Meta/template leakage posing as content

The doc explains that it uses “categorical proportions (e.g., 4-stage cycle = 25% per stage)”—that’s a scaffolding hack, not biology. It admits the visuals are “pedagogic constructs” until data exists. This is a fancy way to say: placeholders. 

Comprehensive_DOCX_Report_Life_…

4) Bad/irrelevant sources, missing in-text citations

References include Microsoft Create (template site), Galaxy.ai report generator, MisfitAnimals, a generic blog “entomologist.net,” and Studocu. These are not peer-reviewed or authoritative biology sources for lifecycle facts. No in-text citations tie claims to these references. 

Comprehensive_DOCX_Report_Life_…

One decent outreach source shows up (YourWildlife PDF), but it’s mixed with low-cred material.

5) Hallucinated methodology and “methods” boilerplate

“Research methodology included systematic data collection…” with no dataset, protocol, instruments, or variables. This is generic filler; nothing is reproducible.

6) Not clearly about ants (beyond the title)

The body contains generic “subject matter” wording and presentation boilerplate; almost no concrete, cited biology (e.g., stage durations, caste differentiation, species examples) made it into the text.

7) Structure promises, content doesn’t deliver

Sections exist (Executive Summary, Methods, Results, Discussion), but they’re skeletal and cut off. No tables, no stage timeline, no colony diagram, no glossary. 

Comprehensive_DOCX_Report_Life_…

8) Accessibility & formatting are performative

Captions are there, but with no images; there’s no alt text, no table of figures, no styles beyond headings. 

Comprehensive_DOCX_Report_Life_…

9) “25% per stage” is pedagogically wrong

Treating egg/larva/pupa/adult as equal “quarters” is misleading. Real stage durations vary widely by species and temperature. The doc pushes this 25% gimmick instead of either (a) citing a range or (b) clearly labeling it as a schematic—not data.

Non-negotiable fix list for the Replit agent (one pass)
A) Fail-closed content gate (no more half docs)

Before export, validate a JSON payload. If any required field is empty, truncated, or meta-leaky, abort the export.

Required sections & minima

Cover: title, subtitle, author, date.

Executive Summary: 250–400 words (complete sentences; no ellipses).

Introduction: ≥600 words; defines 4 stages (egg, larva, pupa, adult) and distinguishes colony development vs individual lifecycle.

Methods: concrete method or explicit “No primary data; literature synthesis only” label.

Results: ≥600 words with ≥3 embedded figures (PNG) and ≥1 table.

Discussion: ≥600 words; limitations + next steps.

References: formatted (APA/CSL), mapped to in-text citations [Author, Year].

Reject if body contains: slide|presentation|template|will include|pedagogic construct (case-insensitive).

B) Source policy (replace the junk)

Whitelist (examples): peer-reviewed journals; university/extension (.edu/.gov); museum/natural-history institutions.

Blacklist in final references: template galleries (create.microsoft.com), AI “report generator” sites, Studocu, MisfitAnimals, generic blogs like “entomologist.net” unless the author is a credentialed entomologist with citable publication. Any blacklisted domain → export fails. (Current file contains several.) 

Comprehensive_DOCX_Report_Life_…

Enforce that each factual claim in Intro/Results has at least one in-text citation that resolves to the bibliography.

C) Figures that are real (and accessible)

Render charts/diagrams to PNG and embed (no raw URLs).

Each figure: caption (F1, F2…), alt text, and 3–6 line interpretation.

Include at least one schematic life-stage timeline and one colony caste diagram with honest labeling (“schematic” vs “empirical”) if no numeric durations are used.

D) Table(s) with concrete, verifiable content

Insert at least one table summarizing stage names, typical duration ranges by example species (citations), and notes. No invented numbers; if not available, use ranges from credible sources and cite.

E) Accuracy & scope corrections

Delete the “25% per stage” trick unless it’s clearly labeled diagrammatic and not used in analysis.

Write explicit text on temperature/seasonality effects and species variability (cited).

If no primary data is used, state that clearly and stop pretending “systematic data collection” happened.

F) Truncation/overflow bug fix

Audit the DOCX writer (e.g., python-docx or whatever you use):

Ensure paragraph concatenation does not exceed library run limits.

Disable silent token truncation; chunk long sections.

Add a post-write “open & scan” check to catch trailing ellipses or empty figures.

G) Final leakage & quality checks (automated)

Leak check: reject if /slide|presentation|template|will include|pedagogic construct/i in the DOCX text.

Figure presence: ≥3 images embedded as image/* parts.

Alt text on all images.

Citations: number of in-text [Author, Year] ≥ number of unique claims flagged by your sentence classifier.

Blacklist domains absent from refs. (Current doc fails.)

H) Packaging

DOCX opens in Word/Google Docs with embedded images (not links).

Optional: include a short “Further Reading” (3–5 vetted sources) separate from formal references.

Paste-this directive to the agent

Deliver a finished, accurate ants report, not scaffolding.

Implement the fail-closed JSON schema above and refuse export on missing/truncated/meta content.

Replace weak sources; only keep scholarly/.edu/.gov/natural-history. Remove Microsoft Create, Galaxy.ai, Studocu, MisfitAnimals, generic blogs. Add proper in-text citations that resolve to the bibliography. 

Comprehensive_DOCX_Report_Life_…

Embed ≥3 PNG figures with captions + alt text (life-stage timeline, colony caste diagram, and one optional chart). No placeholder captions.

Add a table with stage names and cited duration ranges (or clearly mark as schematic if ranges aren’t available).

Kill the “25% per stage” pseudo-quant; only keep it as a clearly labeled schematic, not data.

Fix DOCX truncation—no ellipses mid-section; chunk/stream long paragraphs.

Run leak checks, figure presence checks, alt-text checks, and blacklist checks. Fail the build if any trip.

Return the DOCX as a downloadable artifact and paste a one-page Executive Summary excerpt in chat to prove it’s real, complete prose.

If they “fix” it again without embedded figures, in-text citations, and complete prose, it’s not fixed—send them back to Step 1 and fail the export by design.
