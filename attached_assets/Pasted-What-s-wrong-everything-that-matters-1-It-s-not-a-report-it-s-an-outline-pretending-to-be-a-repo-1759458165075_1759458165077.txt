What’s wrong (everything that matters)
1) It’s not a report; it’s an outline pretending to be a report

The file repeatedly describes what a slide or section “will” contain instead of actually providing content. That’s meta-outline language, not a deliverable. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

It leans on “template guidance” and “this slide…” across sections rather than writing the section. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

2) Placeholders and empty promises instead of substance

Whole sections are bullet lists of what should be there (e.g., “One-page narrative… pointers to figures…”), but there’s no narrative, no figures, no data. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Copy repeats fragments like “egg, larva, pupa, and adult” with no actual biology, methods, or results filled in. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

3) Source quality is weak or irrelevant

Relies on Microsoft Create (a design template gallery) as if it were a scientific source; that’s layout advice, not biology. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Cites Scribd, GeeksforGeeks, general blogs, and summary pages as informing biology/methods—these are not primary or peer-reviewed authorities. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Mentions UC IPM and a YourWildlife PDF (ok for outreach) but still treats them at the same level as blogs and template sites. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

4) No data, no figures, no embedded charts

Visualization sections merely list what types of charts could exist, not actual figures, images, or embedded assets appropriate for DOCX. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

There’s guidance to use PNG/SVG and packaging advice, yet the file contains zero actual images or tables. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

5) Formatting and voice are wrong for a DOCX deliverable

Consistent use of “This slide…” throughout a supposed Word report. That’s a workflow/PowerPoint artifact bleeding into a DOCX. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Future tense (“will be… will adopt… will describe…”) instead of completed, declarative report prose. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

6) Misaligned structure vs. promised content

Sections specify “Executive Summary, Methods, Results, Discussion…” but none of those sections actually contain those parts—just bullets promising them. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

References are pasted as a grab-bag without in-text citations tied to claims, so you can’t trace any statement to a source. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

7) Likely prompt/template leakage

Repeated mentions of “Microsoft Create templates” and “this slide will…” suggest the generator piped internal scaffolding into the final document instead of compiling it into finished copy.

8) Accessibility is performative, not implemented

It talks about alt-text and accessibility but embeds no actual images or alt text. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

9) Reproducibility claims with no reproducible material

Mentions R Markdown/python-docx, version control, data-availability notes—none of which are provided or linked.

What the agent must fix (one pass, no regressions)
A) Hard “content compiler” contract (no more outlines)

Implement a strict schema the generator must satisfy before saving a DOCX:

cover: {title, subtitle, author, date} — required

exec_summary: 250–400 words, plain text — required

introduction: >=600 words with in-text citations [Author, Year] — required

methods: >=600 words + at least one table — required

results: >=600 words + ≥3 embedded charts/images — required

discussion: >=600 words with citations — required

references: CSL/APA formatted, deduped — required

figures: [ {caption, image(binary/png), altText} … ] — required
Block save if any required field is empty, in future tense, or contains “This slide/This section will…”.

B) Source policy (whitelist + blacklist)

Whitelist: peer-reviewed journals, university/extension sites, government/standards bodies, museum/natural history institutions (e.g., UC IPM, academic presses).

Blacklist in final prose: Microsoft Create (layouts only), Scribd mirrors, GeeksforGeeks summaries, blogs like “entomologist.net” (unless the author is a credentialed entomologist and the piece is citable), essay farms (IvyPanda), ResearchGate non-peer-review uploads. The current file violates this repeatedly. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Enforce: every factual claim requires at least one whitelisted citation; fail the build if blacklist domains appear in references.

C) Chart/image pipeline that actually embeds

Render charts to PNG (or SVG converted to PNG) and embed them; no raw URLs or “will include figure” notes.

Each figure must have: number, caption, altText, and a 5–10 line interpretation below it.

Include adjacent data tables for each figure (small, readable). The file currently has none. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

D) Sanitization & leakage prevention

Strip any string matching \b(this slide|will (describe|include)|template|Microsoft Create)\b from final prose (allowed in internal logs only). Current draft leaks these meta-phrases. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Replace with concrete content before export.

E) Formatting & style enforcement (Word)

Apply a real DOCX style set: Heading 1–3, Normal, Caption, Table Text.

Intro/Methods/Results/Discussion each >600 words; Executive Summary ≤1 page; consistent 11–12 pt body; 1.15–1.2 line spacing. The current file only talks about styles. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

F) References done properly

Replace the “link dump” with formatted references; enforce in-text citations that resolve to the bibliography. The current dump is unlinked to claims. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Deduplicate, add publication year, publisher/journal, DOI where available.

G) Accuracy & scope fixes (biology)

Require a concise, species-agnostic life-cycle section (egg → larva → pupa → adult) with actual durations/ranges and ecological notes, cited to primary/academic sources—not tutorial blogs. The present copy is fragmentary. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Distinguish clearly between organism life-stage biology and colony-level phases; tie claims to citations (not to layout sites). 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

H) QA gates (fail the build if unmet)

No future tense in body (except in “Next steps”).

Min word count per section met.

≥3 figures embedded with captions & alt text.

Leak check: reject if any of: “This slide”, “will include”, “template”, “Microsoft Create” appear in exported DOCX.

Source check: reject if blacklist domains appear in references.

Accessibility: all images must have alt text.

I) Packaging

DOCX must open without corruption and contain images as image/* parts—not external links.

Provide a zipped “Figures/” folder and a “Data/” folder with CSVs used in figures (or a short statement if synthetic/educational).

One-shot acceptance checklist for the agent

Mark these PASS/FAIL before replying “fixed”:

Structure: Cover, Exec Summary, Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion, References, Appendices all present and non-empty (meets word counts).

No meta text: grep output; zero matches for This slide|will include|Microsoft Create. (The current file fails here.) 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Citations: All claims with [Author, Year]; bibliography formatted; no Scribd/GeeksforGeeks/IvyPanda/“template” URLs. (Current file lists them.) 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Figures: ≥3 embedded PNGs with captions + adjacent small tables. (Current file has none; only “will include” talk.) 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Accessibility: all images have alt text.

Accuracy: A clear, cited description of stages + colony phases with durations/ranges and proper sources (not blogs). (Current file: fragmentary.) 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

No prompt leakage anywhere in the DOCX.

Packaging: DOCX opens in Word/Google Docs; images embedded as parts; figures/data shipped.

TL;DR for the agent (pin this)

Stop outputting outlines. Compile finished prose.

Replace weak sources with vetted academic/extension sources; blacklist template/blog/“essay help” domains from the reference list. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Embed real charts/images; no raw URLs; add captions + alt text. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Purge “This slide/ will include / Microsoft Create” from final DOCX. 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

 

Life_Cycle_of_Ants_DOCX_Report_…

Enforce a strict schema + QA gates that fail the build if any required content is missing or meta.

Ship a DOCX that reads like a report, not a project plan.
